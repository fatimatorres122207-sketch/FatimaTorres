                <h2>My Passion!</h2>
                <div class="info-box">

<p>I've always loved otome games.
    These are story-based video games were players can control a protagonist who forms romantic realationships
     with male characters through visual storytelling, dialogue, and player choices that
      influence the narrative and lead to different endings.
    I loved playing the indie versions on Itch.io! There I discover game delevloper logs where they talked about the progess of the game. I found out they made them through Renpy that uses phython to create those types of games. I decided to try making a game for myself and I really enjoyed it. I now try to learn as much code as I can to be able to create a small comapny to create otome games!</p>

<p>My Itch.io page is still in process. I've posted a game with 2,000 downloads but I privated it due to it being a year old and embarrassed about my art skills. But I will be making a new game with new art! Made by my friend Sydney!</div></p>
